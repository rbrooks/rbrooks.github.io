  <p>This section describes how this site was made, the tools used, and the technologies behind it.</p>

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Graphic</h3>

<p>This site was hand-crafted using the finest two-dimensional graphics application in the world, Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/2007/4/7/swatch_color_scheme.gif" alt="Color Scheme"/></p>

<p>Warm and cozy - nothing jarring and boisterous. I knew I wanted earth tones this time because Mother Nature is often the best art-school professor and, frankly, my last site was a kitschy Christmas lawn ornament, built 7 years ago, prior to my research into color science.  During a recent Doo-Wop&#8211;themed design for a Harley-Davidson dealer, I happened upon and fell in love with this bistre, powder blue, saffron combination.  It hearkens back to 40&#8217;s and 50&#8217;s-era design, for which, I have a new-found admiration.  I desaturated it to relax it and shifted the colors somewhat to bring an ever so small amount of green into the browns&#8212;slightly olive if you stare long enough, emulating the primary wall color in my home [which those ever-clever, paint-naming folks tagged, &#8220;Khaki Shadow&#8221;].</p>

<h3>Markup and Stylesheets</h3>

<p>Hypertext is hand-authored to the XHTML 1.0 Strict standard.  Cascading Style Sheets were also hand-authored and contain a combination of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 properties.</p>

<h3>Photography</h3>

<p>All photography throughout the site is mine.</p>

<h3>Typography</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>Body Font</strong> - Trebuchet - 1.6em leading</li>
<li><strong>Headings</strong> - Georgia, Small-Caps.  I was using fascinating technique called, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/stories/flashsatay/">Flash Satay</a>, to display headings in my logo font, Minister, but performance suffered too much with a lot of headings on the page.</li>
<li><strong>Logo</strong> - A gorgeous Adobe typeface called &#8220;Minister&#8221; that I finally found after hours of scouring the Adobe Font Folio, OpenType Edition.  I wanted classy but subtly informal.  The small caps, Melior x-height, and the below-the-baseline stem on the &#8220;R&#8221; are all characteristics of my own handwriting.  Minister&#8217;s oblique stresses and concave serifs keep it playful and less stuffy.  Perfect.</li>
<li><strong>Nav Bar</strong> - Futura Bold - A timeless classic!</li>
<li><strong>Sidebar Headings</strong> - Futura Heavy</li>
<li><strong>Type on Photos</strong> - Bickham Script - Ligatures, swash, and ornaments active</li>
</ul>

<h2>Programming Language and Framework</h2>

<h3>Ruby on Rails</h3>

<p>Born and raise Microsoft Windows, I initially spent about three months, nights and weekends, writing this entire site from scratch in C# on ASP.NET.  I had the journal completely finished [I refuse to use the term &#8220;blog&#8221;], as well as the user management system, authentication and role-based permissioning system, and the core workings of a photo gallery.  Somewhere in the midst of that process, Ruby on Rails caught my fascination and I committed myself to learning it.  I decided that I would rewrite my site on Rails to learn the technology.  I bought every known textbook on Ruby and Rails, built a Linux box [Kubuntu], and immersed myself for another several months in this innovative web development framework.  What you are looking at is the culmination of those efforts.</p>

<h2>Development Tools</h2>

<h3>Eclipse</h3>

<p>I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE with the <a href="http://subclipse.tigris.org/">Subclipse</a> and <a href="http://www.aptana.com/docs/index.php/Integrating_RadRails_with_Aptana">RadRails</a> plugins.</p>

<h2>Revision Control System</h2>

<h3>Subversion</h3>

<p>All source code is held in <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> running on Windows 2003 Server.</p>

<h2>Database</h2>

<h3>SQLite</h3>

<p>I bounced back and forth between MySQL and SQLite during development.  I decided that I would launch the site with a SQLite back-end, given the site&#8217;s very low load.  I love the portability and elegant simplicity of SQLite. It &#8220;just works&#8221; and it&#8217;s fast. Since it is a single file and resides within my Eclipse project, I can check it in and out of Subversion as I bounce between my Windows and Linux workstations.  If my traffic suddenly spikes to thousands of concurrent connections, I&#8217;ll explore MySQL or PostgreS.</p>

<h2>Operating System</h2>

<h3>Kubuntu</h3>

<p>Of course, I had to run the Linux OS that everyone is talking about! &lt;kidding&gt; After a lot of research, the Ubuntu family seemed like the wise choice. I went with <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a> over <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> because I like the KDE user-interface better than Gnome.  Gnome seems to have sacrificed power for simplicity. I prefer power and, apparently, <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8745257437.html">so does Linux creator, Linus Torvalds</a>.</p>

<p>I should mention that my early dabblings in Ruby on Rails were on Windows XP, against my better judgment.  Experience has repeatedly indicated to me that software runs better in its native environment.  At some point, I hit a few obstacles on Windows XP that would not have existed on Linux.  Without getting into details here, let&#8217;s just say that I am now successfully developing and running Rails in both environments, but things were far more seamless [less troublesome] on the Linux side, as expected.  Plus, everything performs better, from development tools to frameworks to web servers to database technologies.  Do yourself a favor.  Run software in its native environment.</p>

<h2>Web Server</h2>

<h3>nginx / Mongrel Cluster</h3>

<p>Pronounced &#8220;engine x&#8221;, <a href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> is the latest lightening-fast, rock-solid HTTP server from Russia. Performance tests show that <a href="http://blog.kovyrin.net/2006/08/22/high-performance-rails-nginx-lighttpd-mongrel/">nginx is 50% faster than Lighttpd</a> and <a href="http://digitalbadger.net/archives/30-LigHTTPd-and-Apache-Symfony-benchmarks.html">Lighttpd is 250% faster than Apache</a>. Unlike the two aforementioned products, it has a very small memory footprint and no leakage problems. Apache has been shown to leak 20MB per day with certain Rails apps. Lighttpd has known bugs in its mod_proxy plugin that cause repeated 500 errors, and the developers don&#8217;t appear to be attending to it any time soon. The Mongrel developer actually <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/docs/lighttpd.html">advises against Lighttpd&#8217;s usage</a>. Given all these facts, nginx is my front-line reverse proxy serving all requests for static content, for example, images, JavaScript, and CSS.  Ruby on Rails execution is handled by a cluster of three <a href="http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/">Mongrel</a> instances, with nginx distributing the load. I am <strong>thoroughly</strong> impressed with the speed and stability of this setup.</p>
